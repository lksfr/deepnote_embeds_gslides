Google Slides does not allow for embedded content, making it difficult to integrate in modern, notebook-centric analytics efforts. Copying large numbers of screenshots or saved plots into slides just to have to repeat the process once the data or code change is far from ideal. Use this code to build a workaround Google Slides add-on that will...

- Enable you to add Deepnote Embeds using the same link you'd use to embed elsewhere
- Refresh all of your "embeds" with a single click across all of your presentations ðŸŽ‰

## How To

1. Download the repo.
2. Change the file-ending of *embed.js* to *embed.gs* and create a new Google Apps Script project.
3. Create an account for any service offering screenshots through API calls (like screenshotapi.net) or build your own & replac _<TOKEN>_ in the embed.js file with your personal token.
4. Add the three files to the project & create a test deployment into your own Google account.
5. Have fun with it.
